# Week 4
## Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The script in `run_analysis.R` performs an exploratory analysis on **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones** [dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) on five steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. :heavy_check_mark:
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. :heavy_check_mark:
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. :heavy_check_mark:
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. :heavy_check_mark:
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. :heavy_check_mark:

Finally, the data is exported to one text file (`done.txt`).
